# About Me

Iâ€™m a self-coached web wizard with 4 years of experience conjuring up high-quality, scalable web applications for Microsoft and other top-tier clients. My toolkit? JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, React, React Native, REST APIsâ€”you name it. Iâ€™m all about crafting delightful customer experiences and pushing the boundaries with personal projects. Oh, and recently, Iâ€™ve taken on a new adventure as a Prompt Engineer at Remotasks, helping improve AI models like ChatGPT to make them as sharp and human-like as possible.

If you spot something funky, feel free to let me know. Iâ€™m always up for some bug hunting and squashing. Happy exploring! âœ¨
